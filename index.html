        <h3>Sweet 21 Jane</h3>
        <p>My Love,</p>
        <p>Happy Birthday, my beautiful Janna! 🎉🎂</p>
        <p>On this special day, I just want to remind you how much you mean to me. From the moment you walked into my life, everything became brighter, warmer, and more beautiful.</p> 
        <p>You are my happiness, my peace, and my greatest blessing. Every smile of yours melts my heart, every laugh fills my soul, and every moment with you is a treasure I cherish.</p> 
        <p>I love the way your eyes light up when you're excited, the way you care so deeply, and the way you make even the smallest moments feel magical.</p>
        <p>Today is all about celebrating you—your kindness, your strength, and the incredible person you are. I hope this day brings you as much joy as you bring into my life every single day.</p> 
        <p>I promise to always stand by your side, to love you endlessly, and to make every day as special as today. Happy Birthday, my love! Here’s to many more birthdays together, to laughter, to love, and to a future filled with endless happiness.</p>
        <p>Forever yours, <br>Imran ❤️</p>
